give the name of your desired filepath as the first argument to the program and it will save the content of the file in a doubly linked list on demand.
with arrow keys you can move forward and backward (in this sense it's more like **less** since is has pagination).
the size of buffer is based on st_blksize of the file acquired by stat systemcall and of course you can change it.

I beleive data structers are very well understood in C/C++ since you have a full control over pointers, it's also more prone to error for naive programmers.
